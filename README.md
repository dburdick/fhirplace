# fhirplace

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhirbase/fhirplace.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fhirbase/fhirplace)

FHIR Server implementation powered by
[FHIRBase](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase).

## Installation

FHIRPlace and FHIRBase both are using a lot of third-party software
like PostgreSQL, Java, Node.js, etc. Installing it by hand is an
complex task which can take several working days to accomplish.

Fortunatelly, another approach is available nowadays. Instead of
installing all required software manually, one can use virtualization
technologies to run a "virtual machine" with alredy pre-configured
operating system.

To quickly get FHIRPlace up and running we advice you to follow
virtualization path. If you're willing to install FHIRPlace to your
local machine or server, please follow full
[Installation Manual](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirplace/wiki/InstallationManual).

## Running FHIRPlace's Virtual Machine

### Mac OS X and Windows

If you're running Windows or Mac OS X, you have to install
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtualization
software. Installation process is quite straightforward, so we don't
describe it here. If problems arise, refer to
[Official Installation Manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html).

### Linux

If you're runnig some flavour of Linux, make sure you have Docker installed:

```bash
$ docker --version # or docker.io --version
```

If `docker` binary is not present, install it using your
distributive's package manager, e.g. `sudo apt-get install docker.io`.

### Installing Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a simple and powerful
command-line utility to manage virtual machines primary intended for
developers use. Navigate to
[downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to get an
installer suitable for your OS. After installation is finished, run
Terminal application (on Mac OS X) or Command Prompt (on Windows) to
test if installation was successful. Type following command:

```bash
vagrant --version
```

If you see output like

```bash
Vagrant 1.6.5
```

you had successfuly installed Vagrant.

### Getting FHIRPlace source code

You have to get FHIRPlace source code to run FHIRPlace. If you have
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) SCM installed, clone FHIRPlace repository
from GitHub. Alternatively, you can download
[ZIP archive](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirplace/archive/master.zip)
and unpack it somewhere in your file system.

### Starting VMs

Open Terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to directory where
FHIRPlace's source code is located, e.g.:

```bash
cd ~/work/fhirplace
```

Then start FHIRPlace VMs with command:

```bash
vagrant up fhirbase && vagrant up fhirplace
```

Initial VMs startup can take a lot of time because Vagrant have to
download several OS images (about 1.5 Gb total) and unpack them. Next
startups will be much faster (almost instant).

If Vagrant won't report any errors, direct your browser to
http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see FHIRPlace welcome page.

### Stopping VMs

When you finish your work with FHIRPlace, you may decide to stop running
VMs to free system resources that they have allocated. This can be done with
following command:

```bash
vagrant halt fhirbase fhirplace
```

## Accessing FHIRBase

You can access FHIRBase directly using any PostgreSQL client like
`psql` utility or [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/). Use following
connection paremeters:

| Parameter | Value     |
|-----------+-----------|
| host      | localhost |
| port      | 5433      |
| user      | fhirbase  |
| password  | fhirbase  |
